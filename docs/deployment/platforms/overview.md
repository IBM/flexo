## Deployment Considerations

### Resource Requirements

- Recommended Minimum Memory: 6GB
- Recommended Minimum CPU: 2 vCPU
- Storage: Based on usage

Note: Number of uvicorn workers can be set using `UVICORN_WORKERS`. The default is calculated dynamically and set as `2 Ã— num_vCPUs + 1`.

### Configuration Management
Each platform provides different methods for:

- Environment variables
- Secret management
- Volume mounts
- Network policies

### Monitoring and Logging
Consider platform-specific solutions for:

- Health monitoring
- Log aggregation
- Performance metrics
- Alert management
